    // "To do this, we will modify our start request handler to make it wait
    // 10 seconds before returning its "Hello Start" string. Because there is
    // no such thing as sleep() in JavaScript, we will use a clever hack for
    // that."

    // "[The] start() [function] contains a blocking operation. Like in "it's
    // blocking everything else from working". And that is a problem, because,
    // as the saying goes: "In node, everything runs in parallel, except your
    // code". What that means is that Node.js can handle a lot of concurrent
